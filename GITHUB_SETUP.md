# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Your local git repository is ready! Follow these steps to connect it to GitHub:

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `claude-runner-game`
3. Description: "Chrome T-Rex runner game - standalone version"
4. Keep it **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/jvzingarelli/claude-runner-game.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you prefer SSH (recommended if you have SSH keys set up):
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:jvzingarelli/claude-runner-game.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see:
- Your index.html file
- README.md
- .gitignore
- Your initial commit

## Troubleshooting

If you get an authentication error:
1. Make sure you're logged into GitHub
2. If using HTTPS, you may need to use a Personal Access Token instead of your password
3. Consider setting up SSH keys for easier authentication
